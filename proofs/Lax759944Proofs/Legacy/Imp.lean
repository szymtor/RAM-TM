IMP+: a structured while-language with scalar variables and named
arrays, given a big-step semantics indexed by a cost. It is the layer
at which the flatness of the machine is dealt with once and for all:
the compiler to machine programs lowers control flow to jumps and array
indexing to indirect addressing, and everything above IMP+ reasons
structurally.

IMP+ is the *unbounded* reference semantics: its values are natural
numbers, nothing is ever reduced modulo `2 ^ w`, and the word length
does not occur in this file at all. That is the whole point of the
tower — functional correctness and cost are proved on clean
natural-number arithmetic, and the word length enters exactly once, at
the boundary, through the value bound of `Bounds` and the simulation
theorem. The operators are the standard word-RAM operations at the
level of numbers: subtraction is truncated, division rounds down with
`x / 0 = 0`, the bitwise operations are those of `Nat`, and the shifts
are multiplication and division by a power of two. Six of them are
machine instructions; the other three — `or`, `xor` and `shiftr` — are
lowered by the compiler to fixed blocks of three or four instructions,
so the choice of operators here is not a choice about the machine.

Three design points carry the weight.

*Aliasing is impossible by construction.* An environment maps names to
values and names to arrays, so distinct names denote disjoint objects
and no statement anywhere in the tower has to reason about overlap.
This is what replaces separation logic.

*Out-of-bounds access is stuck, not defaulted.* Expression evaluation
is `Option`-valued and an out-of-range array read has no value; an
out-of-range store has no derivation. A semantics that defaulted to
zero would diverge from what the flat machine memory returns, and the
layout simulation would then be false.

*Input and output are commands.* The environment carries the two tapes
and `read`/`write` are ordinary constructs, so their cost is part of
the cost of the run and the compiled program needs neither a prologue
that copies the input into memory nor an epilogue that writes the
output out. Array lengths are not declared anywhere: they belong to the
initial environment, because the compiled machine program never
represents them — memory starts zeroed, so an array of any length is
there for free, and its length exists only to make an out-of-range
access stuck.

The cost of a derivation is the number of executed constructs, each
weighted by the size of the expressions it evaluates. Constants are
never tight anywhere in this development; this measure is chosen only
so that it is bounded below by the number of steps of the compiled
machine program divided by a program-dependent constant.

The binary operators are collected into one type `Bop` rather than
given one `Expr` constructor each: they all evaluate the same way and
compile to one block each, so a single `bin` node turns nine cases into
one everywhere downstream, and the six that are machine instructions
are told apart from the three that are lowered in exactly one place,
the compiler's `binCode`.
The nine familiar names are available as abbreviations, so `.add e f`
still writes a sum.
