/-!
The compiler from IMP+ to word-machine programs.

Its whole content is the memory layout, because the machine has no
structure at all: cells addressed by number, an instruction per cell
transfer, absolute jumps. Three regions, all at statically known
addresses since the machine's memory starts empty
(`Lax759944Proofs.Legacy.Ram.initState`):

* cells `0 … temps+1` hold temporaries, one per nesting depth of the
  expression being evaluated plus the two the deepest one needs beside
  it;
* cell `temps + 2 + i` holds the `i`-th scalar variable;
* cell `temps + 2 + p + j + q * i` holds entry `i` of the `j`-th array,
  where `p` is the number of scalars and `q` the number of arrays.

The arrays are *interleaved* rather than laid out in blocks. Their
lengths are not known to the compiler, so blocks would start at
addresses known only at run time; striding by the number of arrays keeps
every address an affine function of the index with statically known
coefficients, at the price of one multiplication per access and a factor
`q` of address space. Address space is nearly free: there is no space
measure, and the only cost is that the word length has to be large
enough to address the last cell, which is what `Layout.span` measures.

Jump targets are absolute, so the compiler takes the address at which
the block it emits will be placed, and the length of a block has to be
known before it is emitted. `size` computes it, and `compile_length`
says the two agree.

### Depths

An expression compiled at depth `d` leaves its value *in cell `d`*, and
may use the cells from `d` upwards. It uses `d + 1` for whichever
operand it compiles second, and the three operators that are not machine
instructions use `d + 2` as well, because both operands have to stay
live while the intermediate `b ∧ c` or `2 ^ c` is formed. `Expr.Ok`
demands `d < L.temps` of every node that has a subexpression, so a
compiled expression writes only cells `d … L.temps + 1` — which is why
the layout reserves `L.temps + 2` cells rather than `L.temps`, and why
every layout literal downstream keeps the `temps` it always had.

The operands of a binary operator are compiled at consecutive depths,
the second operand first: `f` into cell `d`, then `e` into cell `d + 1`,
which cannot disturb cell `d`, and then one block reading `d + 1` and
`d`. Six of the nine operators are machine instructions and their block
is that one instruction; `or`, `xor` and `shiftr` are lowered to the
three- and four-instruction blocks the concept's notes tabulate, whose
correctness is the three identities of `Machine.lean`. This is what
`binCode` is, and it is the only place in the tower where the difference
between the reference language's operators and the machine's shows.

Conditions leave *zero exactly when they hold* in cell `0`, so both are
followed by the same `jzero 0`; truncated subtraction is what makes this
possible without a comparison instruction, and it is the reason the
model keeps monus.

/-! ### The block of a binary operator

Six of the nine operators are machine instructions; the other three are
the blocks of the concept's notes. All of them read the second operand
from cell `d + 1` and the first from cell `d`, and leave the result in
cell `d`; the lowered ones use cell `d + 2` as scratch, and `xor` uses
cell `d` itself for the intermediate `b ∨ c`, which is why it needs no
further cell. -/

/-! ### The equations of `Ok`

A definition written by pattern matching gets its equation lemmas —
and, with them, the `splitter` of its match — only when something first
asks for them, and they are created *in the module that asks*. Checking
a concrete program against `Ok` is `simp [Com.Ok, Cond.Ok, Expr.Ok]`,
and every consumer of this kit does it, so without the three lemmas
below the first consumer creates the equations; a consumer in another
package then holds declarations named under `Lax759944Proofs.Legacy`, which the
archive's namespace rule rejects. Asking here, where the definitions
live, is enough: a later `simp [Com.Ok]` anywhere finds the equations
among its imports and creates nothing.

The splitters carry the names `compileExpr.match_1` and `size.match_1`
rather than `Expr.Ok`'s and `Com.Ok`'s, because Lean shares one matcher
between all matches of the same shape and those two came first.

The statements themselves are the trivial cases of `Ok`, which is all
that is wanted from them; only the `simp` in the proof matters. -/

Distinct names, and distinct entries of an array, get distinct cells;
temporaries are below everything else. This is the only place where the
interleaving of the arrays has to be argued: the entry `i` of the `j`-th
array sits at `j + q * i`, and `j < q` recovers both `j` and `i` from
that number as its remainder and quotient. -/
