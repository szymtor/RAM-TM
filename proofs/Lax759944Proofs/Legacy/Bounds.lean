The no-overflow side of the pipeline.

The machine reduces every value it produces modulo `2 ^ w`; IMP+ does
not. The two therefore agree exactly when no value of the IMP+ run
reaches `2 ^ w`, and that is the only extra obligation the pipeline
asks of its users. This file says what "no value of the run reaches
`B`" means, in the form the simulation consumes and the reasoning layer
can compose.

The bound is threaded through the big-step derivation. `Expr.evalB B`
is expression evaluation that additionally gets stuck as soon as some
value it produces reaches `B` — not only the value of the whole
expression, but the value of every subexpression, since `sub`, `div`,
the bitwise operators and the right shift can all return a small value
from large arguments, and the machine truncates the arguments too.
`BigStepB B` is then the big-step semantics driven by `Expr.evalB B`,
with the same constructors, the same costs and the same shape; it is a
refinement of `BigStep`, not a competitor to it, and `BigStepB.bigStep`
projects one to the other.

This is one derivation carrying two facts, which is what makes the
reasoning layer cheap: a Hoare-style rule proved for `BigStepB`
establishes cost and boundedness at once, and the plain semantics is
recovered by projection wherever functional correctness is argued.

Values that enter the run from the input tape are not produced by any
expression, so they are bounded separately, by `Env.InpBounded`; this
is the hypothesis that becomes "every entry of the input fits into a
word" at the boundary, where the concept's admissible sets already
carry conditions of that shape.
