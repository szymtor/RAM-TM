/-!
The simulation theorem: a terminating IMP+ run whose values all stay
below `B` is matched, at every word length `w` with `B ≤ 2 ^ w`, by a
run of the compiled machine program, in a number of steps bounded by a
constant of the layout times the cost of the IMP+ run.

The word length is dealt with in one line of mathematics, repeated at
every instruction: `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt`. Under the bound, every value the
machine produces is already a word, so every `% 2 ^ w` of the concept's
semantics is the identity and the word machine tracks the unbounded
reference semantics of IMP+ exactly — not up to congruence modulo
`2 ^ w`, but on the nose. The one place where a value is *not* a word is
the shifted power of two of the lowered right shift, and there the
truncation is what makes the block right: `2 ^ n % 2 ^ w` is zero for a
shift distance of `w` or more, and division by zero is zero, which is
what the shift of a word by that distance is anyway.

The boundedness invariant is threaded through the ported induction
rather than routed through an auxiliary unbounded machine: there is
exactly one place per instruction where the bound is needed, the
hypotheses that supply it (`Layout.FitsWords` and the bounded
derivation) are already in scope there, and an intermediate machine
would have to be defined, given its own simulation, and then bridged —
three artefacts where the invariant costs one hypothesis.

The invariant is `Represents`: each scalar sits in its cell, each array
entry *within its declared length* sits in its cell, and the tapes
agree. Array lengths never reach the machine — they only decide which
IMP+ programs have a derivation — so the all-zero memory of a starting
machine represents an environment whose arrays are zero-filled, of
whatever lengths.

Straight-line code is described by `Reaches`, which bundles what every
such block guarantees: it gets to the instruction just past itself, in
at most as many steps as it has instructions, with the tapes untouched,
and touching only the temporaries from `d` upwards. That last clause is
the frame condition, and it is why the compiler can compile the operands
of a binary operator at consecutive depths and rely on the first result
surviving the second computation. What a block *computes* is not part of
`Reaches`: on this machine a value lives in a cell, so the value a block
leaves is stated separately, as `s'.mem d = v`, and the frame condition
is what carries it forward.

`Layout.idxCode` is the only place where the interleaved layout is

Every intermediate is below the address it builds, which the layout's

/-! ### Expressions -/

/-- Compiled expressions: the code evaluates `e` into the temporary `d`,
falls through, leaves the tapes alone, and writes only to temporaries
from `d` upwards. The bounded evaluation is what makes this an
equality: every value the machine produces along the way is a word, so
no reduction modulo `2 ^ w` is visible. -/

/-! ### From an IMP+ derivation to a machine run

The two ends are joined here: the all-zero memory of a starting machine
represents the initial environment for *any* declared array lengths,
and the halt instruction after the code is what stops the machine. -/

/-- The starting machine state represents the starting environment, no
matter what lengths its arrays are declared with: zeroed memory holds a
zero-filled array of every length at once. -/
theorem represents_initState (L : Layout) (ext : String → ℕ) (x : List ℕ) :
    Represents L (initEnv ext x) (initState x) where
  vars _ _ := rfl
  arrs a _ i _ := by
    show (0 : ℕ) = (List.replicate (ext a) 0).getD i 0
    rw [List.getD_eq_getElem?_getD]
    rcases h : (List.replicate (ext a) 0)[i]? with _ | u
    · rfl
    · have := List.mem_of_getElem? h
      simp only [List.mem_replicate] at this
      rw [this.2]; rfl
  inp := rfl
  out := rfl

/-- **The simulation theorem.** Let an IMP+ program `c` run on input
`x` to a final environment at cost `k`, with every value it produces
below `B`, and let `w` be a word length at which the layout and the
bound fit — `B ≤ 2 ^ w` and `L.span B ≤ 2 ^ w`. Then the compiled
machine program, at word length `w`, runs on the same input, halts with
the same output, and executes at most `L.const * k` instructions. The
constant depends on the layout alone: not on the program, not on the
input, and not on the word length. The array lengths `ext` are the
user's free choice and cost nothing. -/

/-! ### A sanity check

The interface is exercised once, on the smallest program that writes
anything, so that the hypotheses of the simulation theorem are known to
be dischargeable and its conclusion is known to be a statement about
the machine of the concept. Programs are the business of the layers
above this one. -/
