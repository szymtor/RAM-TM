import Lax13.Ram

/-!
Proof-internal accumulator microcode for the Turing simulator. Based on the
Lax13 accumulator semantics at d35ba57ad420ce6a6d3c763aa7f6a4a8be1d406d,
with a word-complement operation added for the cell-to-cell translation.

This is NOT the public RAM model. Public programs and executions use
`Lax13.Ram`; a separate checked translation must connect them to this
intermediate language. The accumulator is represented by a Turing work tape.
