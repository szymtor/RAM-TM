title: Binary encoding of finite words
type: definition
---
A finite list of natural numbers is encoded over a three-symbol alphabet.
Each number begins with a separator and is followed by its canonical
least-significant-bit-first binary expansion. Thus zero is represented by a
separator with no following bits, and the next separator begins the next
number. The empty list is represented by the empty string.

This encoding is self-delimiting at the level of numbers: separators cannot
occur as binary digits. Its length is the common input-size measure used by
the Turing-machine and word-RAM polynomial-time definitions in this
submission.
